In this project, I learn to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.

The mobile robots is a smaller version of what was created in this repo:

The map is generated by pgm_map_creator package on the world created in this repo:

The main task of this project is to explore, add and tune specific parameters corresponding to amcl and config files (for cost plan). A successful localization means the robot is able to identify where it is in the map after moving to a specific goal. In this project, one can nudge the localization performance by setting the initial position of robots in Rviz map the same as it is in Gazebo world (beware of different orientation between the map the the world).
