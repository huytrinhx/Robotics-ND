# Overview

In this project, I learn to utilize ROS AMCL package to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the Gazebo simulation environments.

The mobile robots is a smaller version of what was created in the Chase It project.

The map is generated by pgm_map_creator package.

The main task of this project is to explore, add and tune specific parameters corresponding to amcl and config files (for cost plan). A successful localization means the robot is able to identify where it is in the map after moving to a specific goal. In this project, one can nudge the localization performance by setting the initial position of robots in Rviz map the same as it is in Gazebo world (beware of different orientation between the map the the world).

# Quickstart

- Copy the src folder into your catkin workspace and then run:

`catkin_make`

- Launch the world and Rviz by this command in the current terminal:

`roslaunch my_robot world.launch`

You should see robot, the world and Rvix showing up

- Launch AMCL package by this command in a new terminal:

`roslaunch my_robot amcl.launch`

In Rviz, you should see the robot, clouded by red particles in a map.

- To drive the bot around and see localization in action, run this command in a terminal:

`rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py`

Now, you will see changing shapes of the red particles cloud as it's filtering the robot's current position in the map.

# Key Parameters:

* ~update_min_d: 0.05 (m)
* ~update_min_a: 0.02 (rad)
* ~laser_max_beams: 50
* ~laser_max_range: 20 (m)


# Challenges

* A smaller update_min_* means more frequent update during moving.
* Moving slowly may help localization since the localization takes time to run and update the Rviz
* Making my robot smaller or environment bigger helps as that means the robot has more space to manuveure.
