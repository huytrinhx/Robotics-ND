# Robotics

 This repo comprises of projects completed while enrolling in Udacity's Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree
 
## Build My World

- In this project, I learned to work with Model Editor and Building Editor in Gazebo. In particular, I learned how to embed a two-wheeled robot I designed into a world structure.

## Go Chase It

- Based on the previous project, I now equiped the bot with a lidar and a camera. Then I created a package that will drive the robot toward a white ball in the world.

## Where Am I

- In this project, I learned to utilize ROS AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization) to accurately localize a mobile robot inside a map in the world. 

## Map My World

- In real life, many environments do not have known maps. In this project, I learned to create a 2D occupancy grid and 3D octomap of the environment from sensor data using RTAB-Map package

## Home Service Robot

- Finally, putting everything together, I simulated a full home service robot that finds a path to pickup zone and then travel to dropoff zone.
